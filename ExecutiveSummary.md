# Executive Summary

The system has 2 main parts focusing around licensing & vulnerability information and policy documents. The developer uploads package level documents to be scanned by Fossology for licenses and the NIST vulnerability database to capture vulnerability information. Once scanned it is sent to a data store which can be accessed by the developer and managers. Developers and manager may also request policy documents for a separate policy data store. Manages also have the added ability to upload new and modify old policy documents.
